Phase 5: Advanced Correlation Features

ADVANCED FEATURES:

1. Association-Level Correlation
   - Track all studies in a DICOM association
   - Show "what happened during this C-STORE session"

2. Batch Processing Correlation  
   - Group related studies (same patient, same exam)
   - Track multi-study processing workflows

3. Cross-Study Correlation
   - Track related studies (priors, comparisons)
   - Show patient-level processing history

4. Performance Analytics
   - Processing time analysis per correlation
   - Bottleneck identification
   - Success/failure rate tracking

IMPLEMENTATION:

File: app/models/correlation_models.py
```python
class CorrelationGroup(SQLAlchemyBase):
    """Groups related correlations together"""
    __tablename__ = "correlation_groups"
    
    id: str = Field(primary_key=True)
    group_type: str  # "association", "batch", "patient"
    created_at: datetime
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]  # JSON field

class CorrelationRelationship(SQLAlchemyBase):
    """Tracks relationships between correlations"""
    __tablename__ = "correlation_relationships"
    
    parent_correlation_id: str
    child_correlation_id: str
    relationship_type: str  # "spawned", "related", "batch"
    created_at: datetime
```

File: app/services/correlation_service.py
```python
class CorrelationService:
    
    def create_association_group(self, calling_ae: str, source_ip: str) -> str:
        """Create correlation group for DICOM association"""
        group_id = f"assoc-{generate_correlation_id()}"
        
        group = CorrelationGroup(
            id=group_id,
            group_type="association",
            metadata={
                "calling_ae": calling_ae,
                "source_ip": source_ip,
                "started_at": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
            }
        )
        return group_id
    
    def link_correlations(self, parent_id: str, child_id: str, relationship: str):
        """Create relationship between correlation IDs"""
        relationship = CorrelationRelationship(
            parent_correlation_id=parent_id,
            child_correlation_id=child_id,
            relationship_type=relationship
        )
        
    def get_related_correlations(self, correlation_id: str) -> List[str]:
        """Get all correlations related to this one"""
        pass
        
    def analyze_processing_performance(self, correlation_id: str) -> Dict:
        """Analyze processing performance for correlation"""
        # Get all events
        # Calculate timing metrics
        # Identify bottlenecks
        pass
```

FRONTEND FEATURES:

1. Correlation Timeline View
   - Visual timeline of all processing steps
   - Color-coded by service and outcome
   - Expandable details for each step

2. Association Browser
   - "Show all studies from this C-STORE session"
   - Summary of session outcomes
   - Batch operations on related studies

3. Performance Dashboard
   - Processing time trends
   - Success/failure rates by correlation
   - Service performance metrics

4. Smart Log Filtering
   - "Show me similar processing patterns"
   - "Find all failed correlations like this one"
   - Correlation-based log recommendations

ADVANCED QUERIES:

```sql
-- Find all correlations that failed in storage
SELECT DISTINCT correlation_id 
FROM processing_results pr
JOIN correlation_groups cg ON pr.correlation_id = cg.id
WHERE pr.status = 'FAILED' 
  AND pr.error_stage = 'STORAGE'
  AND cg.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 HOURS';

-- Get processing time distribution  
SELECT 
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM completed_at - started_at)) as avg_processing_seconds,
    MIN(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM completed_at - started_at)) as min_processing_seconds,
    MAX(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM completed_at - started_at)) as max_processing_seconds
FROM processing_traces 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 DAYS'
  AND status = 'COMPLETED';
```

MONITORING & ALERTING:

1. Correlation Health Checks
   - Alert on stuck correlations (no progress for X minutes)
   - Alert on high error rates for specific patterns

2. Performance Monitoring
   - Track processing time SLAs per correlation type
   - Alert on performance degradation

3. Capacity Planning
   - Correlation volume trends
   - Resource utilization per correlation pattern
